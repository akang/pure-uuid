Abstract
--------

This is a pure JavaScript implementation for the generation of DCE
1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996 and IETF RFC-4122 compliant Universally Unique
Identifier (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1
(time and node based), version 3 (name based, MD5), version 4 (random
number based) and version 5 (name based, SHA-1). It can be used in both
[Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) based server and browser based client
environments.
